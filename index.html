									<p>Story about an individual who loses their job in a gig economy. This topic has profound importance as we are all experiencing the effects of the dwindling job market. To give a unique perspective, we decided to set the story in India and incorporate an angle about trans discrimination in hopes of shedding light on the plight and misery of trans people and gig economy workers.</p>

									<p>Gig workers are usually not employees, but independent contractors. That means they don't get things like health insurance, paid time off, or retirement benefits.</p>

									<p>Babu Rao (they/them) had been an honest and hardworking food delivery driver for Swigomatz, an online food delivery platform, grappling with the world of ratings and incentives. They had built a strong reputation and a group of regular customers, who were impressed with the quality of their work. However, things changed when, suddenly, they received a bad review from one of their customers.</p>

The manager said that one of Babu Rao’s customers left negative reviews after realizing that they were transgender.

									<p>One day, Babu Rao met his journalist friend, Sagar. Sagar noticed the bleak expression on Babu Rao’s face and upon questioning, was informed of their recent removal from Swigomatz. Sagar was numb; in all his years of journaling, he had never come across such a situation. Through the conversation, Sagar realized that it would be apt to publish an article on the situation. It was important to inform the public of this discrimination and prevent others from facing this in the future.</p>

									<p>It was also important for gig economies such as Swigomatz to understand that a single customer review should not be used to determine the employment of a worker, especially without hearing the worker’s side of the story.</p>

									<h2 class="major">Conclusion</h2>
									<p>The idea was a success. In no time, the article gained the support of millions of people, who were strongly against the discrimination faced by Babu Rao. In addition, Swigomatz faced backslash from the public and was forced to offer Babu Rao an apology. They agreed to listen to Babu Rao’s side of the story. Swigomatz also decided to modify some policies of the company such that employment is not solely determined by customer reviews as that is extremely unreasonable. When Swigomatz realized that Babu Rao had always prioritized the quality of his work, they rehired him to the company. Swigomatz also became an example for all other gig economies to modify their policy structure to prevent this kind of situation from occurring ever again.</p>
